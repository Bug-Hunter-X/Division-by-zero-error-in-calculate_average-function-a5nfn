# Division by Zero Error in PHP Function
This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP: division by zero. The `calculate_average` function calculates the average of an array of numbers.  However, it doesn't handle the case where the array is empty or contains only zeros, leading to a division by zero error.

The `bug.php` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.php` provides a corrected version with robust error handling.
